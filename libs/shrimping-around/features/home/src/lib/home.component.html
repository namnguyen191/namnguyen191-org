    <p>
      Neocaridina shrimp are a popular species of freshwater shrimp often kept in aquariums due to
      their small size, vibrant colors, and ease of care. The most famous type is the Neocaridina
      davidi, commonly known as the Cherry Shrimp because of its bright red coloration, though they
      come in many colors, including blue, yellow, and green.
      <br />
      They reproduce easily in the right conditions, which makes them a favorite for hobbyists
      looking to create a self-sustaining shrimp colony.
