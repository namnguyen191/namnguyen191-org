        "text": "Neocaridina pet shrimps, often called \"cherry shrimps,\" are freshwater shrimp popular in aquariums due to their vibrant colors and ease of care. Native to Taiwan, these small creatures come in various color morphs, including red, blue, yellow, and green, making them a lively addition to any tank. Generally growing up to 1-1.5 inches in length, Neocaridina shrimps are peaceful, hardy, and adaptable to a range of water conditions, though they prefer slightly alkaline water with a pH of 6.5-8.0 and a temperature range of 65-80°F (18-27°C).\n\nThese shrimps are excellent tank cleaners, feeding on algae, biofilm, and leftover food, which helps maintain water quality. Ideal for nano and planted tanks, Neocaridina shrimps thrive with low-intensity lighting and live plants, which provide them with places to hide and forage. They are generally easy to breed in captivity, with females producing dozens of tiny, transparent larvae that develop into fully-formed shrimp within weeks. Neocaridina shrimps have a lifespan of 1-2 years, making them a manageable and engaging choice for aquarists looking to add color and activity to their tanks."
